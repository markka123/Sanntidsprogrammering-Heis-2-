Exercise 1 - Theory questions
-----------------------------

### Concepts

What is the difference between *concurrency* and *parallelism*?
> Concurrency incolves logical structuring of code so that multiple tasks can be handeled simultaniously (conceptionally!). Parallelism refers to a processor optimization technique that focuses on executing multiple instructions/tasks simultaniously. Thus, the main difference is that concurrency is a conceptional structuring of code so that tasks are dealt with simultainiously, while paralellism refers to the "physical" execution of multiple tasks at the same time.

What is the difference between a *race condition* and a *data race*? 
> A race condition is 
 
*Very* roughly - what does a *scheduler* do, and how does it do it?
> *Your answer here* 


### Engineering

Why would we use multiple threads? What kinds of problems do threads solve?
> *Your answer here*

Some languages support "fibers" (sometimes called "green threads") or "coroutines"? What are they, and why would we rather use them over threads?
> *Your answer here*

Does creating concurrent programs make the programmer's life easier? Harder? Maybe both?
> *Your answer here*

What do you think is best - *shared variables* or *message passing*?
